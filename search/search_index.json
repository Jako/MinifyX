[[!+MinifyX.javascript]] [[!+MinifyX.css]] The snippet and the placeholder have to be called both uncached or both cached. It they are called cached, the generated minified files are only created when the resource is not cached, so you can't change the minified assets on the fly. There is an internal MinifyX cache used, so it is not a real issue to call the snippet uncached. Use without placeholder If you don't want to use the placeholder, you can replace the following lines in the snippet call above. &registerCss=`default` &registerJs=`default` That way, the snippet will insert the script and style tags automatically in the code with the MODX regClient methods.
